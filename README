	USAGE: genpw.sh [-i [-f file] | [-a] [-c] [-l length] [-s]] [-f file] service-name]

	Generates a password from a master password and a service name.
	When a service name is used with -a, -c, -l or -s, the flags used are saved in a data file.
	The data file may be specified with -f (default ".genpw_data").

	OPTIONS:
		-i	Saves the master password hash in the data file. Cannot be used with other options except -f.
		-a	Includes an alphabetic character. Overwrites any preferences in the data file.
		-c	Mixed case. If -c is used, -a becomes redundant. Overwrites any preferences in the data file.
		-l	Returns a password of at least a set length. Overwrites any preferences in the data file.
		-s	Append special character '*'. Overwrites any preferences in the data file.
		-f	Use a specified data file. Default is ".genpw_data".
